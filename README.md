Mcgill Hackathon 2016 - Percolation

To Run:

- Use Matlab2015a or later
- Run percolationGUI.m, or percolationGUI_GPUaccel.m if a CUDA-enabled GPU is available and MATLAB parallelization toolbox is installed
- If the GPU acceleration is used, run resetGPU.m after closing the GUI to insure no memory is still reserved on the GPU.

PCAstuff folder contains attempts at doing statistical analysis on the output.
